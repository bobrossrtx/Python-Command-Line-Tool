# Hello all,

## What it is
This small command line tool was / is mainly just a way for me to learn and get used to python.
Since I started programming in early October, I kinda dived straight into web development, 
which by the way didn't go too bad. My main problem with it was I didn't really and truly understand languages
like JavaScript, but I continued to use it which personally, I don't think was the best choice for where I
was, I knew I shouldn't continue with JavaScript in the meantime, but I did.

It took me until I looked into what python could be used for and found out that it could be used for the 
exact same things I was trying to do, like ye... Python may not exactly be made for web development, but
I took note that it could do it. The main interest within programming for me was developing websites, and 
I will stick to that interest, and I decided to make things easier and decided to know python.

Since I did get concept from learning some JavaScript, It had made this quite easy to do. 
I know this is not a website, but it was something that got me started with python. I believe if I can do this
in such an early stage of learning python, I think I will do just fine when it comes to creating 
websites using python. Once I have learned a python to a reasonable standard to learn another language,
I will go back to JavaScript.

## How it will work
This will be a project that I continuously work on though out learning python to find better ways to
improve it and make it better.

I will title stages of my learning experience on my [GitHub](https://github.com/bobrossrtx). I will 
also record every stage of my progression in this README for people that discover my repo.
